This guide serves as the unified source of truth for all contributors, both human engineers and automation agents.

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```shell
<type>[(<scope>)][!]: <description>

[<body>]

[<footer>]
```

### Type

- `<type>(<scope>)!`: Breaking change. (major version bump except for `v0.x.x` where it bumps minor version)
- `feat`: New feature or enhancement. (minor version bump)
- `fix`: Bug fix. (patch version bump)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- `style`: Code style changes (whitespace, formatting, etc.) that do not affect functionality.
- `test`: Only test-related changes.
- `docs`: Only documentation changes.
- `chore`: Changes without a direct impact on the codebase (build process, dependencies, etc.).

### Scope

- `workflow`: Changes related to CI/CD workflows.
- `jira`: Changes related to Jira.

## Development Guidelines

- Use `mise` for Python version management.
- Run `mise run install` to install dependencies.
- Run `mise run test` to run tests.
